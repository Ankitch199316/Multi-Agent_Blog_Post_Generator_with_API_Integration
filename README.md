using a multi-agent system. The system consists of three key agents:

PlanningAgent: Researches the topic using external APIs (like web search and news APIs) and creates a structured plan for the blog post.
ContentWriterAgent: Writes a draft based on the plan provided by the PlanningAgent.
EditorAgent: Refines and polishes the draft into a final blog post.
The code integrates with external APIs to gather research data, enabling the agents to produce informed and relevant content. Additionally, it includes features like error handling (e.g., for API key issues) and logging for debugging, though these are implementation details not highlighted in the title. The title is concise yet descriptive, capturing the essence of the code's ability to generate blog posts through collaborative agents and API-driven research, applicable to any topic
